# JUREON
Product: A deterministic legal verification system that transforms legal reasoning from artisanal craft to reproducible engineering.
Core Innovation: The .jvf (Jureon Verification File) format—a legally cognizable chain-of-custody container that makes legal certainty portable, durable, and verifiable.
